So, why did I create this blog? And why build a custom implementation instead of using well-established platforms like Medium or WordPress?

To answer the first question, I've wanted a space to share my thoughts for a long time. The initial idea came from my father, who encouraged me to read and think a lot. As a result, my brain produces a lot of thoughts that I, and sometimes others, find valuable. The problem is, these thoughts get erased from my memory very quickly (maybe I have ADHD, but I've never been checked :p).

I also want to foster good conversations among people. I believe the evolution of humanity is fundamentally driven by our ability to collaborate. Think about the life of a single adult human being and how much information they process. In other words, every person receives various inputs every second—what they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and feel through their skin. This information is then processed in their brain and combined with their previous experiences and knowledge. Every second, a new thought is born, which ultimately contributes to different kinds of intelligence, personalities, and knowledge. This means every one of us is unique. So, if we can combine these various forms of human intelligence when solving a problem, it helps us expand our search space and reach a solution faster.

I guess that summarizes my main motivation for writing things down.

Next, why did I choose Jekyll to create this blog? The main reason is that I wanted the flexibility to present content in various ways: text, images, audio, video—anything. I also needed to present this content without barriers like "premium versions" to read more. Ultimately, I want to have ownership of the content and the platform where I present my thoughts.

If you've read this far, thank you for your time. I encourage you to share your thoughts with others. Have meaningful discussions. Try to find new people to talk to. I believe this will make the world, or at least your corner of it, a better place.

I'll stop here for now, but I will keep experimenting with different ways of writing these kinds of blog posts.
